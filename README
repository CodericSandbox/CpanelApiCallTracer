cPanel API Call Tracer

This package contains the cPanel API Call Tracer, which is used to trace cPanel's API1 and API2.  

This allows you to view the input and output from every API call used within the cPanel interface.  This module should NEVER be used on a production server for more than a few seconds as all passwords used in the APIs are passed to it and logged to a file.  Furthermore, it create a possible race condition where two users can attempt to write to the same file, causing the cPanel interface to crash.

To disable it, after it's use, simply move /usr/local/cpanel/Cpanel/CustomEventHandler.pm to another filename and delete /dev/shm/apiout.tmp

Version 1.0

INSTALL
-------
Copy Dumper.pm to /usr/local/cpanel/perl/Data
Copy CustomEvenyHandler.pm to /usr/local/cpanel/Cpanel, if you have a previous existing CustomEventHandler in place, you will need to move it out of the way in order to use this module

USAGE
-----
This will output all information relevant to an API call in Data::Dumper format to the error_log.  /dev/shm is used for temporary storage of this data.

Please consult the Data::Dumper documentation on CPAN for information on what the various symbols used in the output mean.

$cfgref is the input provided to API calls
$dataref is the output given by API calls
