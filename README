Custom Event Handler Dumper

Version 1.0

INSTALL
-------
Copy Dumper.pm to /usr/local/cpanel/perl/Data
Copy CustomEvenyHandler.pm to /usr/local/cpanel/Cpanel, if you have a previous existing CustomEventHandler in place, you will need to move it out of the way in order to use this module

USAGE
-----
The purpose of this module is to dump all information passed to Cpanel::CustomEventHandler::event() to the error_log.  It will output all the variables in the normal dumper format plus a little more information.  /dev/shm should be available on any system running this as this is used to log API1 calls.

This module should NEVER be used on a production server as all passwords used in the APIs are passed to it.
